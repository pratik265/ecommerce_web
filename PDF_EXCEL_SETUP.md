# PDF and Excel Export Setup Guide

## Current Status
The current implementation uses workarounds for PDF and Excel exports:
- PDF exports create printable HTML files (.html extension)
- Excel exports create CSV files (.csv extension)

## For Proper PDF Generation

### Option 1: Install TCPDF (Recommended)
1. Download TCPDF from: https://github.com/tecnickcom/TCPDF
2. Extract to `application/third_party/tcpdf/`
3. Update the PDF library to use TCPDF

### Option 2: Install wkhtmltopdf
1. Download wkhtmltopdf from: https://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html
2. Install on your server
3. Update the PDF library to use wkhtmltopdf

### Option 3: Use Online PDF Services
- Use services like PDFShift, DocRaptor, or similar
- Update the PDF library to make API calls

## For Proper Excel Generation

### Option 1: Install PHPSpreadsheet (Recommended)
1. Install via Composer:
```bash
composer require phpoffice/phpspreadsheet
```

2. Update the Excel library to use PHPSpreadsheet

### Option 2: Use Online Excel Services
- Use services like SheetJS or similar
- Update the Excel library to make API calls

## Quick Fix for Current Issues

### To Fix PDF Extension Issue:
The current PDF library creates HTML files. To make them appear as PDFs:
1. Open the downloaded .html file in a browser
2. Use browser's "Print to PDF" function
3. Or install a browser extension for PDF conversion

### To Fix Excel Opening Issue:
The current Excel library creates CSV files. To open them in Excel:
1. Open Excel
2. Go to File > Open
3. Select "All Files" in the file type dropdown
4. Open the .csv file
5. Excel will automatically format it as a spreadsheet

## Recommended Implementation

For production use, install TCPDF and PHPSpreadsheet:

```bash
# Install PHPSpreadsheet via Composer
composer require phpoffice/phpspreadsheet

# Download TCPDF manually and place in application/third_party/tcpdf/
```

Then update the libraries to use these proper libraries instead of the current workarounds.
